How to Contribute
=================

I welcome any and all ideas and code to Vash. There are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

* Before rewriting major portions of code, open an Issue to discuss it. Someone might be working on what you want already!
* Maintain code style whenever possible: make your code look like the code around it.

Building Vash for distribution
------------------------------

Simple as:

	$ npm run build

And tests (includes `build` task):

	$ npm test
